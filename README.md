# Depth-Estimation_Project
## Overview

The Depth Estimation Project aims to develop a robust and efficient depth estimation model using Python. Depth estimation is a crucial aspect of computer vision, enabling applications such as 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. This project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately predict depth from a single image or stereo image pairs.

## Features

- **Single Image Depth Estimation**: Predicts depth from a single RGB image.
- **Stereo Depth Estimation**: Computes depth using stereo image pairs.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for performance, suitable for real-time applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy usage.

## Installation

To set up the Depth Estimation Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkshayKeerth/Depth-Estimation-Project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Depth-Estimation-Project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the depth estimation model, use the following command:

On Windows:

python depth_estimation.py

On Linux:

python3 depth_estimation.py

## Model Architecture
The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for depth estimation. The architecture is designed to effectively capture spatial hierarchies in images, allowing for accurate depth predictions. The model is trained on diverse datasets to generalize well across various scenes.

## Key Components:
Encoder-Decoder Structure: Captures high-level features and reconstructs depth information.
Skip Connections: Facilitates better gradient flow and feature reuse.
Loss Functions: Utilizes depth-aware loss functions for improved accuracy.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [KITTI Depth Dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php)
, which contains a diverse set of images with corresponding ground truth depth maps.

## Results
The model demonstrates competitive performance in depth estimation tasks, achieving an average error of X% on the test set. Sample results are present in the images directory.
